    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, welcome to my shiny new blog. It is long since I have been wanting to set up a professional blog, something that
others call a <em>blog for hackers</em>. It is called like that, I believe, because no online, fancy wysiwyg editor is used and
instead you use professional tools such as Git and a bunch of well crafted Ruby scripts, although you only need to 
follow a cookbook (from which a small deviation may break everything down and you need to hack around a little bit,
for real).</p>

<p>Well, I want to test its features now. I am editing with IntelliJ and Markdown. Nothing spectacular, it might be my
personal set up, because the plugin at my job is definitely more functional.</p>

<p>Now a code snippet. I follow the instructions at Octopress’ website.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">env <span class="nv">x</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;() { :;}; echo vulnerable&#39;</span> bash -c <span class="s2">&quot;echo this is a test&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Check. Beautiful. Lovin’ it.</p>

<p>Now for my second prerequisite which was a big concern for me regarding moving to a blogging platform: maths! I wan’t
to be able to edit in Latex. The lack of it is a no go. Luckily, I found
<a href="http://www.idryman.org/blog/2012/03/10/writing-math-equations-on-octopress/">this helpful blog post</a>, which describes how
to do precisely that. Testing:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
</script>

<p>Check. Awesome! Sold!</p>

<p>Apparently, you write your post in this markdown file, which you compile with the provided tool, which gets sucked up
by a local web server that helps you visualize your results, before pushing it up to your Github repo. I like that.</p>

<p>Let be it! I am moving to Github Pages + Octopress.</p>

<p>Edit: I forgot to test Youtube video insertion. ~Apparently you need a <a href="https://github.com/optikfluffel/octopress-responsive-video-embed">plugin</a>~ 
This is done by pasting the <em>iframe</em> tag as given by youtube.
OK, cloned, copied Ruby files and test (with current time position including <em>?start=253</em>):</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/X6s6YKlTpfw?start=253" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>No responsiveness as of yet, but it’s fine for now.</p>
