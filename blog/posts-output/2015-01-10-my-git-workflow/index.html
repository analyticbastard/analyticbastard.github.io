    <h2>My Git workflow</h2>
</div>
<div>
    
    <p>In the past I had used CVS as most of the people. Git is much powerful, in so many levels. For starters, you never, NEVER lose files. You can <strong>always</strong> go back to a previous version, the soft ware, or the hard. But Git requires a little more attention on the part of the user than other control version systems. This starts by fixing the basic concepts clearly.</p><h3><a name="concepts"></a>Concepts</h3><p>The concepts, from basic qto more complex, and also sorted by the first time you are likely to come across them, is:</p><ul><li><strong>Tracked file</strong>: A file that is under version control. You specifically told Git to track it at some point of its life.</li><li><strong>Woring directory</strong>: This is the classical concept, your working copy of the project, including the files you   modify, the ones that are tracked and others that you want to leave untracked (such as IDE files or personal notes).</li><li><strong>Local repository</strong>: This is <em>the Git repository stored on your local computer</em>. It is <em>not</em> your local working   directory, but the files stored in the ```.git``` directory within your working copy.</li><li><strong>remote</strong>: A remote is a remote Git server that stores our project. Several remotes can exist for a project and we   always need to specify the remote to which we are going to send our changes.</li><li><strong>Remote repository</strong>: The remote repository that stores the version of the project that everybody can see.</li><li><strong>Branch</strong>: This is the usual concept of branch. Branches of the project may evolve in an independent way from each   other. All commits are attached to a branch. Local branches may not exist in the remote repository and remote branches   may have not been updated in your local repository at some point. The default branch is called <em>master</em>.</li><li><strong>Conflict</strong>: Incompatible changes from a source were incorporated to a dirty copy (meaning that you modify something   that had been already modified), or you have a commit that modifies something already modified in the source you are   applying. You will need to resolve this by hand.</li><li><strong>stash</strong>: Shelve your local changes. In other words, pack your dirty working copy and leave a clean working directory   that matches the contents of your local repository. This is important if you want to do operations on files that you   have changed on your working copy, since Git will complain otherwise.</li><li><strong>unstash</strong>: Get the changes from the stash into your local copy, making it dirty if it was not. If it was not dirty   or you got changes from another branch or from the remote repository, you are likely to have conflicts and will need   to resolve them.</li><li><strong>pull</strong>: Update remote changes in your local repository (and your working copy so you can see them). If you have   a dirty working copy you will need to stash your local changes.</li><li><strong>Dirty local copy</strong>: Tracked files in the working directory that have been changed.</li><li><strong>commit</strong>: A change in a tracked file (dirty local copy) that gets added to the local repository. You commit to a   branch.</li><li><strong>push</strong>: The commits (local changes that now form part of your local repository) get sent to the remote repository   so that everybody can finally access them. This updates the remote branch.</li><li><strong>merge</strong>: This happens when two members have changed the same tracked files on a branch in the the remote   repository. The last user in pushing the changes (<em>B</em>) will need to pull the changes that the first one (<em>A</em>) already pushed,   so that the official history was written firstly by <em>A</em>. The conflicts will most likely need to be resolved by   hand by <em>B</em>, since Git does not understand any particular language (and is not intelligent to decide on the conflicts   or have criteria to do so). Once merged, <em>B</em> ends up with a dirty working copy, that he needs to commit and then push.   This last push will be accepted by the remote repository server (if no one has put new stuff in the meantime).</li><li><strong>rebase</strong>: This is a especially useful type of merge in which a user has not pulled down changes for a while and there   are a number of commits in the remote repository. If the user commits, then he can rebase the remote branch onto his,   so that his commit is merged on top of the remote commits. The user can then push to the remote branch and see his   changes reflected there. The rebase command is very versatile since it allows us to modify previous commits in our   repository.</li><li><strong>reset</strong>: Set your branch to any commit in your repository. At this point a <strong>VERY IMPORTANT NOTE</strong> must be mentioned:   any repository, including the local one, stores commits. This means that commits <em>ALWAYS</em> survive, they are always   present, and one can always reset a branch head to a particular commit if the commit hash is available. It does not   matter that the commit had been "lost" in the branch chain.</li><li><strong>cherry-pick</strong>: One can also cherry-pick a commit in the repository, given its hash, from any branch and apply it   to any other branch. Again, it does not matter that the picked commit does not currently appear on any branch, it   suffices for it to have been stored in the repository at some point.</li><li><strong>log</strong>: This command is useful since it shows the chain of commits we have on our <em>local</em> repository that end up   in our current state. This does not show all the commits that once belonged to a branch if the branch was reset and   then new commits arrived (in a similar way to when we undo something in MS Word and then write new stuff, we cannot   redo). Useful for rebasing stuff.</li><li><strong>reflog</strong>: This is <strong>ALL</strong> the repository history, including committed stuff, branch changes, pulled changes, etc.   You can find <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> here, even commits that were apparently "lost" from a branch. If you feel you have lost   a commit, just issue ```git reflog``` and cherry-pick from there.</li></ul><h3><a name="my&#95;workflow"></a>My workflow</h3><p>When you are developing a new feature for your project, want you want to do is branch the master branch (or any other, but it makes sense to pick up the official state of the project and start from there).</p><pre><code class="bash">git checkout -b newfeature
</code></pre><p>This creates a <strong>local branch</strong>. We are interested in storing our changes remotely so that if something happens to our local copy (major Git messup that is easy to just ignore and pull the remote, hard drive issues, computer issues, get your stuff done in some other computer, etc), we have our changes in the remote server too.</p><pre><code class="bash">git push origin newfeature
git branch --set-origin=origin/newfeature
</code></pre><p>This creates the <strong>remote branch</strong> and sets the default link to our local branch, so that we can push to it.</p><p>After this, we can do our changes. I normally spend some time with a feature and by the time I want to commit to master (when the changes are not enough to be peer reviewed in a pull request to the master branch), some other workmate has committed something, which forces me to <strong>pull</strong> and <strong>rebase</strong>.</p><p>Imagine that I am working on newfeature and I notice that master has changed. It is better to incorporate the remote changes sooner so that conflicts are minimal. I first <strong>stash</strong> my local changes, since I will need to change branch to pull master (you can do it from newfeature branch, but I like it this way).</p><pre><code class="bash">git stash
git checkout master
git pull
</code></pre><p>Now we have the remote latest changes. We switch to the newfeature branch</p><pre><code class="bash">git checkout newfeature
git rebase -i master
</code></pre><p>This tells git to get (local, which was just updated) commits onto the current branch, newfeature. Now newfeature is updated with the latest master state. We can keep on working. Get our latest changes, the ones we stashed.</p><pre><code class="bash">git stash apply
</code></pre><p>This applies the top of the stash to the current clean local branch, and does not remove them from the stash. I am normally interested in keeping these changes just in case. I can later remove them with ```git stash drop```. I sometimes use ```git stash pop``` which applies changes <em>and</em> removes them from the stash. If I need to refer to the stash to get a change that I know was there but am not sure it is on the top, then I use ```git stash show &ndash;name-only```, which gives me the names of the changed files.</p><p>When I feel I can commit (because I am done or because I want to store remotely)</p><pre><code class="bash">git commit -m &quot;Message&quot;
git push origin newfeature
</code></pre><p>Which saves my commits in the remote branch (remote repository).</p><p>I sometimes need to modify something that I committed, because I forgot to include it (and we want our master history to be clean of mistakes and easy to follow), I prepare my local changes (tracked files) for commit fixup. First I use the ```git add``` command to add these files to the subsequent commit. This commit will be done in a special manner: using the ```&ndash;fixup=``` modifier, which accepts the hash of the commit to be modified. This is an extremely versatile modifier, since it allows us to modify commits buried deep beneath our current head. This creates a new commit chain with the fixed commit and all the commits that followed it, with new versions adapted to the changes we have introduced (and of course, all with new hashes, since they are all new commits).</p><p>I came across a very easy command pipe to do this, since adding files one by one is a time waster:</p><pre><code class="bash">git status | grep modified | cut -d: -f2 | xargs git add
</code></pre><p>The command ```status``` gives us the modified files, among other stuff (untracked files, etc). I filter the modified files (getting only the file name) and then add them as an argument to ```git add```.</p><p>We now fix the particular commit. In this case, I get the commit hash with ```git log```.</p><pre><code class="bash">git commit --fixup=24ee1df941679953529aabc3d0eef5727a44c094
</code></pre><p>This creates a <em>new</em> commit on top of the rest. We need to squash everything so that git creates the new commit chain, wich entirely different commits and with the fixing and fixed commits merged into one. If the commit is buried below the head, you would use the commit previous to the one being fixed. Imagine this chain</p><pre><code class="bash">c0cf52f4a914641efdc635bbc6195b6bef084cdc Categories and other plugin stuff

</code></pre><p>If I had pushed my branch to the remote repository, then I would have to force push, since there is no way my local branch and the remote one are compatible. To do that, you need to be pretty sure nobody is in the process of committing anything to that particular branch (this is not a problem if you are working on this feature on your own), and issue</p><pre><code class="bash">git push origin newfeature -f
</code></pre><p>Where origin is my remote repository name and ```-f``` overwrites the remote contents.</p><h3><a name="final&#95;thoughts"></a>Final thoughts</h3><p>We can see that we can modify our commit chain (resetting our branch head or fixing commits). Some people say it changes the history, but I don't see it that way). The true history is in the <strong>reflog</strong>.</p><p>Also, people might find it difficult to think of the usefulness of having several remote repositories. For example, this blog has a remote which is, obviously, Github pages, and it is where the stuff under ```_deploy``` gets sebt.</p>
