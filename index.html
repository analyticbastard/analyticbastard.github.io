  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a collection of methods that are denominated image pan-sharpening, since they use
information available in multiple bands to create an image output that enjoys properties
from all sources, while minimizing drawbacks. The sources combined will contain several
frequency bands, maybe hundreds or thousands. In this case, we are interested in combining
a source with a high resolution but in gray scale, and a RGB image.</p>

<p>This is especially important in satellite imagery, since satellites often incorporate
a multispectral camera with limited resolution and a high-resolution, low-band/grayscale
camera among their equipment.</p>

<p>To play with this, we will use Matlab (since I’ve worked a little bit with its image
functions and array transformations, and this job will be quick)</p>

<h2 id="data-preparation">Data preparation</h2>

<p>We first load original image (included in Matlab)</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="matlab"><span class="line"><span class="n">peppers</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">imread</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;peppers.png&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/peppers.png" title="Original image" alt="images" /></p>

<p>Now we simulate uniband (grayscale) and multiband (downscaled) imagery</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="matlab"><span class="line"><span class="n">multiband</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">imresize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">peppers</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">0.25</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">uniband</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">rgb2gray</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">peppers</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The multiband image looks like this</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/multiband.png" title="Multiband image" alt="images" /></p>

<p>And the high resolution (low band) image looks like this</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/uniband.png" title="High resolution image" alt="images" /></p>

<p>In the first case, we resize the image to a quarter of its size <strong><em>in both dimensions</em></strong>.
This means we loose 15/16 of the information! In the second case we compute a grayscale
image, loosing complementary information.</p>

<p>These two images are the ones we are interested in combining.</p>

<p>We now upscale multiband image (again, color image and same size than original but with
the information from the downscaled version)</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h2 id="image-pan-sharp-with-pca">Image pan-sharp with PCA</h2>

<p>We will now perform PCA on the images. To do that we need to convert the images to the
relevant variables we want to consider in the analysis. In this case, we want to extract
the bands of the images, so that we linearize the images, thus turning matrices into
unidimensional vectors. In case of the grayscale image, this is easily done by just
using the <code>(:)</code> operator. Bit in case of the RGB image, we will need to
reshape into a three-dimensional multivariate X = (R, G, B)</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="matlab"><span class="line"><span class="n">X</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">double</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">reshape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">interpolated</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nb">numel</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">interpolated</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>where we have also converted the data type to double so that we can use Matlab functions.</p>

<p>Now we can compute the components and the projections onto the PCA space</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="matlab"><span class="line"><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">C</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">Y</span><span class="p">]=</span><span class="n">pca</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>where <code>C</code> is the matrix of loadings and <code>Y</code> is the projections of the data onto
the PCA space.</p>

<p>At this point, out of curiosity, we can compute correlations. Notice that the first
projection will correlate a lot with the univariate, since both capture mean luminosity
levels, which is an indicator of which component can be substituted by the higher
resolution grayscale image.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The first one yields around <code>0.98</code>. Substitute the component now</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>We are adapting the maximum and minimum luminosity of the grayscale image to match
that of the first component.</p>

<p>We now project the new components back to the original RGB space. The matrix <code>C</code> is not
orthonormal, so that we don’t get a properly scaled representation, so we do it manually
(we could also make the matrix <code>C</code> orthonormal, though the effect of changing the first
component would have impacted the final luminosity levels and thus we still would have needed
to rescale the colors)</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Lastly we reshape from (R, G, B) multivariate to an RGB image</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="matlab"><span class="line"><span class="n">merged</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nb">reshape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">I</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">size</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">interpolated</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The result shows that, effectively, we enjoy the best part of the two worlds</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/merged.png" title="Merged image" alt="images" /></p>

<p>As mentioned, we could play with the luminiscence levels to attain a color more loyal
to the original.</p>

<p>The reason why this works is that the first PCA component takes most of the information,
thus creating a sort of best fit for all colors in the RGB spectrum. This is a kind of
luminiscence, which is what the grayscape image is and what we substitute it by.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since I took a good course on Matrix Analysis, I have been curious about how Google’s Page Rank algorithm was
related to Matrix theory, because I never got a chance to have a look at it when I studied computer systems.</p>

<p>Imagine the graph of web pages visited by Google crawlers, where <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{M}</script> is the adjacency matrix with the outgoing
links in the columns, where each edge in the web page <script type="math/tex">i</script> pointing to a web page <script type="math/tex">j</script> (which can be the same)
has a score of <script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{n_i}</script>, where <script type="math/tex">n_i</script> is the number of outgoing links in the webpage <script type="math/tex">i</script>. This matrix might
present a number of problems with actual graphs, so what Google did was to include page self references and random
jumps between pages with a small probability given by a parameter <script type="math/tex">\beta</script>.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{G} = \beta \mathbf{M} + (1-\beta) \frac{\mathbf{1} \mathbf{1}^T}{N}</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">N</script> is the total number of web pages in the system and <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{1}</script> is the vector of all ones of size <script type="math/tex">N</script>.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\mathbf{G}</script>, being a stochastic matrix, has one as the largest eigenvalue (in module). This can be proved by taking
<script type="math/tex">\mathbf{G}^T \mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}</script>, and since <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{G}^T = (\mathbf{P}^{-1})^{-T} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{P}{-T}</script>,
where <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{P}</script> diagonalizes <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{G}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{D}</script> is the resulting diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues
of both <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{G}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{G^{T}}</script>. Thus one is also the largest eigenvalue of <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{G}</script>. Proving that
this is in fact the largest can be done by applyting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershgorin_circle_theorem">Gershgoring circle theorem</a>.</p>

<p>Intuitively, applyting <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{G}</script> several times has the effect of building a power matrix <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{G}^M</script> whose
largest eigenvalue is also one, but the rest are the power of elements less than one, meaning that each power decreases
all the eigenvalues except the first one. This has the effect of minimizing the component of any vector (the projection)
in the subspace spanned by the eigenvector corresponding to any eigenvalue except the first one. Eventually, all of them
reach zero, leaving only the component of the original vector in the subspace of the eigenvector corresponding to the
largest eigenvalue. This means
<script type="math/tex">\mathbf{G}^M \mathbf{x} \rightarrow \mathbf{w}</script>, as <script type="math/tex">M</script> tends to infinite, where <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{w}</script> is the dominan
eigenvector (the one corresponding to the eigenvalue one).</p>

<p>The elements of this vectors are the important for all the pages registered on the database by the crawlers or
robots.</p>

<p>Obviously this demands a lot of computation since the web is ever changing and this power method would need to be
performed in batch intermitently, so efficient implementations are needed (based on Map Reduce or not).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the past I had used CVS as most of the people. Git is much powerful, in so many levels. For starters, you never,
NEVER lose files. You can <strong>always</strong> go back to a previous version, the soft ware, or the hard. But Git requires a little
more attention on the part of the user than other control version systems. This starts by fixing the basic concepts
clearly.</p>

<h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>

<p>The concepts, from basic qto more complex, and also sorted by the first time you are likely to come across them, is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tracked file</strong>: A file that is under version control. You specifically told Git to track it at some point of its life.</li>
  <li><strong>Woring directory</strong>: This is the classical concept, your working copy of the project, including the files you
modify, the ones that are tracked and others that you want to leave untracked (such as IDE files or personal notes).</li>
  <li><strong>Local repository</strong>: This is <em>the Git repository stored on your local computer</em>. It is <em>not</em> your local working
directory, but the files stored in the <code>.git</code> directory within your working copy.</li>
  <li><strong>remote</strong>: A remote is a remote Git server that stores our project. Several remotes can exist for a project and we
always need to specify the remote to which we are going to send our changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Remote repository</strong>: The remote repository that stores the version of the project that everybody can see.</li>
  <li><strong>Branch</strong>: This is the usual concept of branch. Branches of the project may evolve in an independent way from each
other. All commits are attached to a branch. Local branches may not exist in the remote repository and remote branches
may have not been updated in your local repository at some point. The default branch is called <em>master</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Conflict</strong>: Incompatible changes from a source were incorporated to a dirty copy (meaning that you modify something
that had been already modified), or you have a commit that modifies something already modified in the source you are
applying. You will need to resolve this by hand.</li>
  <li><strong>stash</strong>: Shelve your local changes. In other words, pack your dirty working copy and leave a clean working directory
that matches the contents of your local repository. This is important if you want to do operations on files that you
have changed on your working copy, since Git will complain otherwise.</li>
  <li><strong>unstash</strong>: Get the changes from the stash into your local copy, making it dirty if it was not. If it was not dirty
or you got changes from another branch or from the remote repository, you are likely to have conflicts and will need
to resolve them.</li>
  <li><strong>pull</strong>: Update remote changes in your local repository (and your working copy so you can see them). If you have
a dirty working copy you will need to stash your local changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Dirty local copy</strong>: Tracked files in the working directory that have been changed.</li>
  <li><strong>commit</strong>: A change in a tracked file (dirty local copy) that gets added to the local repository. You commit to a
branch.</li>
  <li><strong>push</strong>: The commits (local changes that now form part of your local repository) get sent to the remote repository
so that everybody can finally access them. This updates the remote branch.</li>
  <li><strong>merge</strong>: This happens when two members have changed the same tracked files on a branch in the the remote
repository. The last user in pushing the changes (<em>B</em>) will need to pull the changes that the first one (<em>A</em>) already pushed,
so that the official history was written firstly by <em>A</em>. The conflicts will most likely need to be resolved by
hand by <em>B</em>, since Git does not understand any particular language (and is not intelligent to decide on the conflicts
or have criteria to do so). Once merged, <em>B</em> ends up with a dirty working copy, that he needs to commit and then push.
This last push will be accepted by the remote repository server (if no one has put new stuff in the meantime).</li>
  <li><strong>rebase</strong>: This is a especially useful type of merge in which a user has not pulled down changes for a while and there
are a number of commits in the remote repository. If the user commits, then he can rebase the remote branch onto his,
so that his commit is merged on top of the remote commits. The user can then push to the remote branch and see his
changes reflected there. The rebase command is very versatile since it allows us to modify previous commits in our
repository.</li>
  <li><strong>reset</strong>: Set your branch to any commit in your repository. At this point a <strong>VERY IMPORTANT NOTE</strong> must be mentioned:
any repository, including the local one, stores commits. This means that commits <em>ALWAYS</em> survive, they are always
present, and one can always reset a branch head to a particular commit if the commit hash is available. It does not
matter that the commit had been “lost” in the branch chain.</li>
  <li><strong>cherry-pick</strong>: One can also cherry-pick a commit in the repository, given its hash, from any branch and apply it
to any other branch. Again, it does not matter that the picked commit does not currently appear on any branch, it
suffices for it to have been stored in the repository at some point.</li>
  <li><strong>log</strong>: This command is useful since it shows the chain of commits we have on our <em>local</em> repository that end up
in our current state. This does not show all the commits that once belonged to a branch if the branch was reset and
then new commits arrived (in a similar way to when we undo something in MS Word and then write new stuff, we cannot
redo). Useful for rebasing stuff.</li>
  <li><strong>reflog</strong>: This is <strong>ALL</strong> the repository history, including committed stuff, branch changes, pulled changes, etc.
You can find <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> here, even commits that were apparently “lost” from a branch. If you feel you have lost
a commit, just issue <code>git reflog</code> and cherry-pick from there.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-workflow">My workflow</h3>

<p>When you are developing a new feature for your project, want you want to do is branch the master branch (or any other,
but it makes sense to pick up the official state of the project and start from there).</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">git checkout -b newfeature
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This creates a <strong>local branch</strong>. We are interested in storing our changes remotely so that if something happens to our
local copy (major Git messup that is easy to just ignore and pull the remote, hard drive issues, computer issues,
get your stuff done in some other computer, etc), we have our changes in the remote server too.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">git push origin newfeature
</span><span class="line">git branch --set-origin<span class="o">=</span>origin/newfeature
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This creates the <strong>remote branch</strong> and sets the default link to our local branch, so that we can push to it.</p>

<p>After this, we can do our changes. I normally spend some time with a feature and by the time I want to commit to master (when the changes are not enough
to be peer reviewed in a pull request to the master branch), some other workmate has committed something, which forces
me to <strong>pull</strong> and <strong>rebase</strong>.</p>

<p>Imagine that I am working on newfeature and I notice that master has changed. It is better to incorporate the remote
changes sooner so that conflicts are minimal. I first <strong>stash</strong> my local changes, since I will need to change branch
to pull master (you can do it from newfeature branch, but I like it this way).</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">git stash
</span><span class="line">git checkout master
</span><span class="line">git pull
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Now we have the remote latest changes. We switch to the newfeature branch</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">git checkout newfeature
</span><span class="line">git rebase -i master
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This tells git to get (local, which was just updated) commits onto the current branch, newfeature. Now newfeature is
updated with the latest master state. We can keep on working. Get our latest changes, the ones we stashed.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">git stash apply
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This applies the top of the stash to the current clean local branch, and does not remove them from the stash. I am
normally interested in keeping these changes just in case. I can later remove them with <code>git stash drop</code>. I sometimes
use <code>git stash pop</code> which applies changes <em>and</em> removes them from the stash. If I need to refer to the stash to get
a change that I know was there but am not sure it is on the top, then I use <code>git stash show --name-only</code>, which
gives me the names of the changed files.</p>

<p>When I feel I can commit (because I am done or because I want to store remotely)</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Message&quot;</span>
</span><span class="line">git push origin newfeature
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Which saves my commits in the remote branch (remote repository).</p>

<p>I sometimes need to modify something that I committed, because I forgot to include it (and we want our master history
to be clean of mistakes and easy to follow), I prepare my local changes (tracked files) for commit fixup. First I use
the <code>git add</code> command to add these files to the subsequent commit. This commit will be done in a special manner:
using the <code>--fixup=</code> modifier, which accepts the hash of the commit to be modified. This is an extremely versatile
modifier, since it allows us to modify commits buried deep beneath our current head. This creates a new commit chain
with the fixed commit and all the commits that followed it, with new versions adapted to the changes we have introduced
(and of course, all with new hashes, since they are all new commits).</p>

<p>I came across a very easy command pipe to do this, since adding files one by one is a time waster:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">git status <span class="p">|</span> grep modified <span class="p">|</span> cut -d: -f2 <span class="p">|</span> xargs git add
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The command <code>status</code> gives us the modified files, among other stuff (untracked files, etc). I filter the modified files
(getting only the file name) and then add them as an argument to <code>git add</code>.</p>

<p>We now fix the particular commit. In this case, I get the commit hash with <code>git log</code>.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">git commit --fixup<span class="o">=</span>24ee1df941679953529aabc3d0eef5727a44c094
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This creates a <em>new</em> commit on top of the rest. We need to squash everything so that git creates the new commit chain,
wich entirely different commits and with the fixing and fixed commits merged into one. If the commit is buried below
the head, you would use the commit previous to the one being fixed. Imagine this chain</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>When you create the fixup commit, it will appear on top of the chain</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Then you autosquash the chain, selecting the commit previous to the fix</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The result is a new chain</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<p>Where the new <code>7d94aace9629272848382abfc217282c676f108e</code> contains the modifications needed.</p>

<p>In case the commit we want to fix is on top of the chain, the autosquash is simpler:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">git rebase -i --autosquash HEAD~2
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>If I had pushed my branch to the remote repository, then I would have to force push, since there is no way my local
branch and the remote one are compatible. To do that, you need to be pretty sure nobody is in the process of
committing anything to that particular branch (this is not a problem if you are working on this feature on your own),
and issue</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<p>Where origin is my remote repository name and <code>-f</code> overwrites the remote contents.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>

<p>We can see that we can modify our commit chain (resetting our branch head or fixing commits). Some people say it changes
the history, but I don’t see it that way). The true history is in the <strong>reflog</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, people might find it difficult to think of the usefulness of having several remote repositories. For example, this
blog has a remote which is, obviously, Github pages, and it is where the stuff under <code>_deploy</code> gets sebt.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got an ASUS K55VD laptop nearly two years ago and the motherboard broke down without possibility of repair. Not being
able to repair it (I had several technical service shops working on it) was a sting on my heart. Then I recently spotted
an ASUS K55A motherboard (essentially the same except the NVidia 610M chip and no 2 GB external video RAM soldered into
the motherboard) on eBay. That was good enough for me, and I got the item for a very good price.</p>

<p>I managed to assemble the thing and I was lucky enough to get it working. So I ended up with two similar configurations.
I have a decent Ubuntu virtual machine on my Windows laptop, and I use it to play some games from time to time, so I
wanted this spare laptop to be useful in some other meaningful sense. It occurred to me that I could install Mac OSX
and have access to Apple’s tools to compile iOS apps for the iPhone.</p>

<p>Well, you must know that surfing the world of Hackintosh is overwhelming. The hacking is so volatile and the dependency
on each piece of hardware so extreme, that it becomes a pain in the ass for anybody. I don’t know whether to praise or
take pity of the Hackintosh scene such as Tonymacx86, RehabMan, Niresh, etc.</p>

<p>Well, I had a Mac virtual machine on my other laptop, so I downloaded Yosemite and created an installation USB. First
problem, my USB is not bootable. I don’t know whether this problem came from creating it from the virtual machine
(which needs to access the hardware in a non-native way through the host OS), but this was solved by using my Ubuntu
installation to create a HFS+ bootable partition with gParted (subsequent retries with Apple’s disk utility crashed my OSX VM).
With a bootable USB HFS+ partition, I could create a Yosemite installation USB with <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/445-unibeast-install-os-x-yosemite-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html">Unibeast</a>.
I must add that I got the Niresh distribution of Mountain Lion and Mavericks, but could not make it work either
(I don’t remember what the problem was).</p>

<p>Now, booting into the setup, I had some problems with my laptop keyboard and mouse not being recognized, so there was no
possibility of installing the software. What I did was installing <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/multibeast/">Multibeast</a>
<strong>on the USB drive</strong>, adding PS/2 Mouse and Keyboard support in the Multibeast menu (again from the 
virtual machine, to the created USB). With a workable-enough USB installation drive, I removed my previous Windows
partition and installed the vanilla Mac OSX. Then I added the same multibeast support. After booting, my motherboard
would not show my OSX installation as a boot option. I could only boot with my USB and choosing the installation as
partition to start from. I decided to use the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/">Clover</a> bootloader,
which allowed my motherboard to show an EFI startup partition. After some more tweaking, this allowed me to boot from
my Mac OS X installation. Full resolution, no sound. To get sound, I installed VoodooHDA, which created audio feedback.
To solve this, the iGain setting from the VoodooHDA config panel must be set to low or zero. The configuration does not
persist, so one might choose to edit the kext <code>Config.plist</code> and set it there (and rebuild the caches!!!) or use
the VoodooHDA panel config (I don’t quite remember the details of this so you better google it).</p>

<p>I noticed a blinking effect when the computer showed the login screen, and investigating it further revealed that I had
no graphics acceleration. Injecting the 0x01660003 code in Clover had no effect, nor did using any other boot flag. At
this point I was desperate. I decided to run Multibeast once again against my OS X installation and install pretty much
any appealing driver. This (albeit some minor problems with the PS/2 drivers causing a halt in the boot process, solved
my manually deleting the drivers -and updating the cache!!!) granted me full graphics acceleration.</p>

<p>The Wifi card of this laptop (AR5B925) is not compatible since Apple has not released kexts for this chip, nor has any
hacker done so. I got hold of an AR5B97 which is compatible, and installing the <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/network/104850-guide-airport-pcie-half-mini-v2.html">toledaARPT.kext</a>
with the Kext Helper. It is wonderful now to have Internet conectivity, though the Bluetooth is nowhere to be seen,
despite this card having it.</p>

<p>This is it, a process that spanned several days summarized in a small post. I hope it provides you with clues if your
issues are simmilar, but then again, everybody gets different symptoms when dealing with his own Hackintosh.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Principal Component Analysis is a classical statistical technique that aims at finding a transformation of the
input or measured variables so that the transformed variables offer a view of the data that maximizes the presented
“information” about the dataset. This allows for dimensionality reduction, since we can select a number of dimensions
which provide most of the “information” and be sure that each of the rest of the discarded dimensions contain less
information than each of the dimensions we have retained.</p>

<p>We start by requesting something as simple as our solution to be a constrained linear combination (so that the
coefficient vector is of norm one) so that it is of maximum square norm.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\max_{\|\mathbf{w}\|=1}  || \mathbf{X} \mathbf{w} ||^2 \\
\mbox{s.t. }  \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{w_i} = 0
</script>

<p>Maximizing the square norm explains why the first component of non-centered data contains some kind of a data average
for example, the first <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_faces_decomposition.html">eigenface</a> .</p>

<p>where, in the case of the first principal component, there is no $i$ less than one and the constraint does not apply.</p>

<p>Since the scalar product induces a norm, $ \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{w}$ is the norm of $\mathbf{w} $ and the above becomes</p>

<p>Let $\mathbf{X}$ be the data matrix, let $\mathbf{\Sigma} = \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ be the covariance matrix.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\max_{\|\mathbf{w}\|=1}  \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w} \\
\mbox{s.t. }  \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{w_i} = 0
</script>

<p>For the first principal component, this is an quadratical optimization problem constrained to unitary norm of the
solution. This can be written as the optimization of a Rayleigh quotient.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\max_{\mathbf{w}} \frac{\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}}{||\mathbf{w}||^2} \\
\max_{\mathbf{w}} \frac{\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}}{\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{w}} \\
</script>

<p>This is a Rayleigh quotient and it is well known from Matrix Analysis that the solution is in terms of the eigenvector
corresponding to the largest (positive) eigenvalue for covariance matrices (positive definite). 
Remember that $ ||\mathbf{w}|| = 1 \rightarrow  ||\mathbf{w}|| = ||\mathbf{w}||^2 = \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{w} = 1$.
The same result can be
computed from Lagrangian constrained optimization. Taking derivatives and equating to zero</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{w}} \left( \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w} - \lambda \left(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{w} - 1\right) \right) = 0 \\
\mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w} - \lambda \mathbf{w} = 0
</script>

<p>We arrive at</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{w}  = \lambda \mathbf{w}
</script>

<p>Which is an eigenvalue problem (and given the nature of $\mathbf{\Sigma}$, a symmetric one, which benefits from efficient
methods to arrive at solutions. The solution to the maximization problem is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest
eigenvalue. Subsequent components, given orthogonality constraints, are computed with subsequent eigenvectors.</p>

<p>Let $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ the eigenvector matrix (where the eigenvectors of
$\mathbf{\Sigma}$ are the columns of $\mathbf{U}$) and the eigenvalue matrix with the eigenvalues placed in the diagonal,
I usually choose to add the eigenvalue information to the weight combination matrix $\mathbf{W}$ to account for
component spread, but this is of no practical consequence (you can choose to take $\mathbf{W}=\mathbf{U}$, which amounts
to stacking up the vectors $\mathbf{w}$ in columns).</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{D}^{\frac{1}{2}}
</script>

<p>And the transformation of the data is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{W}
</script>

<h3 id="probabilistic-derivation">Probabilistic derivation</h3>

<p>I consider the probabilistic derivation a landmark since a lot of methods have been derived afterwards following
this approach. The seminal paper is <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/67218/bishop-ppca-jrss.pdf">“Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis”, by M. E. Tipping and C. M. Bishop</a>,
published in The Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B.</p>

<p>The probabilistic approach has several benefits, for example, a natural way of handling incomplete data and obtain
transformations even in the presence of missing attributes. This, however, has been rarely implemented on software
packages.  The <a href="http://rgm3.lab.nig.ac.jp/RGM/R_rdfile?f=pcaMethods/man/ppca.Rd&amp;d=R_BC">Probabilistic PCA R Package</a>
supports incomplete data.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I never realized how difficult it was to understand a simple statistical concept such as the test for equality of means
until I had to explain it to my little sister. And I found out that this difficulty stemmed from poor explanations of
my professors and even worse from the textbooks I used to study it. I always ended up using the cookbook recipe,
stating the null hypothesis, performing the computations and stating the results in the correct statistical language.
I never had to explain it in my academic life so I never confronted this particular piece of knowledge and the root of
its difficulty.</p>

<p>My little sister could not understand the meaning of (talking about box plots):</p>

<blockquote><p>If the notches overlap, we reject the null hypothesis (that the means are different) at the 95% level.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even more, the textbook was talking about medians, which made the whole thing a lot more convoluted.</p>

<p>I was shocked, and certainly ashamed, I could not even begin to articulate any word. I was naked, I didn’t know anything
about it. “OK”, I thought, “let’s start from the beginning. What do you <em>really</em> want to do? What you want to do is
test if the two medians of both populations are equal or not, in a statistical sense”. I located a perniciously hidden
important constraint: The variables are normally distributed. “OK, that’s it”. Since their distribution is normal, 
which is symmetrically distributed around the mean, the median turns out to be the mean (and also the mode). The test
is reduced to an equality of means. Now, what would I do with two averages of two samples taken from two normally
distributed populations? For that, one must recall the difference between the average and the mathematical expectation
of a probability distribution (the first moment). The average is an aggregate of the different values of a sample.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i
</script>

<p>Each of the values come from a distribution, which means that each of them is a random variable that acquires a
particular value. This means that the aggregate is also normally distributed.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N X_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma)
</script>

<p>This $\mu$ is the mathematical expectation. Recall that this is a linear operator in the functional analytic sense
of the word <em>operator</em>, that takes a function (probability density) and spits a number in the field the distribution
domain is a subset of (we assume it is the real numbers).</p>

<p>If the random variable is discrete, the operator $E[\cdot] : \ell \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is defined as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
E[X] = \sum_{i \in \mathbb{I}} x_i p_i
</script>

<p>If it is otherwise continuous, $E[\cdot] : \mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
E[X] = \int_{\mathbb{X}} x p(x) dx
</script>

<p>Where $\ell$ (for the lack of a better symbol) is a set of number sequences and $\mathbb{F}$ is a space of functions
whose analysis lies beyond the purpose of this post (just treat them as sets that contain respectively discrete and
continuous density functions). And $p$ (and $p_i$) is the probability density function or the density frequencies.</p>

<p>Then, we know by the law of large numbers that the average converges to the mathematical expectation as the number
of data $N$ tends to infinity.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\bar{x} \rightarrow E[X] = \mu
</script>

<p>Now, with two random variables $X$ and $Y$, under the null hypothesis, their mathematical expectation, or population
means, are the same:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
H_0 : \mu_X = \mu_Y
</script>

<p>So that $\mu_0 - \mu_1 = 0$. This is, the difference must be zero. Now, this is a technicality: The difference is a new
random variable $F=X-Y$ with $E[X-Y]=E[X]-E[Y]=0$ because the operator is linear and the variables
come from the same distribution. <em>This difference is what we use in the test</em>. If we knew more about how it is
distributed, <em>we could query it for possible values to statistically validate the null hypothesis</em> $H_0$. </p>

<p>It turns out that this new difference random variable is also normally distributed and centered
around zero. We can then compute te standard deviation and fix the shape of the distribution, and place a confidence
interval so that the value resulting of the difference of means falls within the 95% of probability density around zero.
This means that if the sample difference is larger that the percentile enclosing this 95% of probability, we are not
<em>accepting</em> the null hypothesis (remember, that $\mu_X = \mu_Y$). Note that with probability 0.05, we are going to get a
sample difference larger than that percentile. For this reason, one does not say <em>reject</em>: There is a chance that the
population means are truly different, bit there is also a small (0.05 probability) chance that, being the population
means the same, we got difference of averages larger than the boundary percentile). </p>

<p>To sum up, the statistical test for equality of means is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two samples from two populations.</li>
  <li>I want to know whether the means are equal.</li>
  <li>Under the hypothesis that they are equal (constrained to normality of populations and independence of samples):
    <ul>
      <li>The difference of means is zero</li>
      <li>Therefore, the difference between sample averages must be small, and it is a random variable itself that must be
normally distributed around zero.</li>
      <li>Once we compute the standard deviation, and hence the shape of this normal distribution of the difference, we
can select the interval to achieve the desired probability to find the value difference of means in the range,
say, 95%. If it falls outside, then we do not accept the null hypothesis (that the difference is zero). We do
this because it should be extremely rare for us to find two samples whose average difference falls ourside the
range (5%) if the null hypothesis is true.</li>
      <li>If it falls inside the 95% range, then there is no statistical evidence against the null hypothesis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A nice tool for both exploratory analysis and teaching is IPython Notebook. It consists of a web server executing
Python commands on an IPython interpreter and a set of Javascript files and CSS style sheets to layout the input and
output correctly and nicely. By connecting to the URL where the server is listening, you access to a book of pages,
each of one contains data input lines in Python and their corresponding beautified output, which can include images
and charts generated by <em>Matplotlib</em> or any other library that produces graphical output.</p>

<p>In the following, I wanted to face a recurrent problem that I have been facing in the past, derived from using
general tools such as Matlab for data analysis tasks. The problem with general tools is that they are easy to grasp and
feel confident with them, maybe too confident. In the case of Matlab, I became too comfortable with the flexibility of
matrices, which allow you to get started quickly since you can easily move data blocks around, but then force you to 
implement your in-house algorithms for data munging, or at least turn you too lazy to look for them 
(in the spirit of “that’ll only take me half an hour and then I’ll devote my time to productive
coding”).</p>

<p>I felt picky today, so I opened up my IPython Notebook server. For data munging, as everything else, one must not
re-invent the wheel, but let oneself use one of the excellent libraries out there. Pandas is an excellent example of
data munging libraries. Here we are going to align two time series, and the problem is the same than in the previous
post, i.e., align two time series with different time indices, such as two stock prices belonging to different markets,
observing different holidays (see the full description and solution in my previous post).</p>

<p>To do that, we concluded that the alignment could be made by merging two Pandas’ DataFrame objects, each containing
a series data (which can be multidimensional, and whose cells will be mixed), which produces some <em>NA</em>s. Then we could
apply the <em>gap</em> <em>NA</em> filling policy, which took the last valid value on each series.</p>

<p>The result, prettified by IPy Notebook can be seen in the figure to the right (you can click on it, a pop up will show
thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/rayfaddis/octopress-BootstrapModal">Bootstrap Image Pop plugin</a>, of which I will
talk in the following post).</p>

<p>As you can see, this makes it especially adequate for information propagation environments such as board presentations
of data analytics or classroom interactive teaching. In the latter case, it is easy to imaging students connecting to
the teacher’s server and inputting their commands, while the teacher corrects them when they are wrong. To update items
in real time, IPy Notebook should contemplate using websockets or any kind of server side events, which I believe
does not so far.</p>

<p>Anyway, it is a great tool to present results in a very neat way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past years I have observed a shift, or convergence one might say, in the tools used in several disciplines
involving data handling or processing. An easy example is this blog, which is made with 
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, a tool heavily based on <em>nerdy</em> concepts such as compilation, version control,
modular building and Markdown syntax, and tools such as Git and the Ruby toolkit. This makes blogging more similar
to software development, as I hinted <a href="/blog/2014/11/01/my-new-blog/">on my first post on this blog</a>.</p>

<p>We find this shift to be a real convergence in the case of data analysis and software development, specifically,
web software development and scripting with Python. This is almost self evident and has been noted previously, in fact,
a blog entry talking about
<a href="http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2013/11/18/the-homogenization-of-scientific-computing-or-why-python-is-steadily-eating-other-languages-lunch/">pythonification of a scientist’s data toolkit</a>
and thinking about my own data analysis toolkit got me writing about this.</p>

<h3 id="the-past">The past</h3>

<p>Previously, I relied primarily on Matlab. Matlab mostly considers matrices as the primary building block in programs
(cells are another very useful structure to consider when elements of a set do not share the same dimension or types).
Everything is a matrix, a hyper-rectangle of things, from scalars to multi-dimensional matrices. This makes moving data
in blocks very easy, since this constitutes an atomic vectorial operation. However, this reduction to the general
case exposes several problems that one normally faces during the data analysis process. For example, one might be
interested in correlating sells with the social sentiment about our product. This involves scraping candidate web
pages, storing interesting parts of the text, performing sentiment analysis, aggregating by date and aligning with
sells by date. This is an unbearable task to do by moving data blocks in Matlab.</p>

<p>R, as in <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">GNU R-Project</a> is a more complete framework for data munging, since it seeks to
replicate the S statistical language in its origins. R, which has the concept of objects, defines a dataframe class
that specifically considers column as attributes and rows as instances, defines a set of methods that allow us to
deal with specialized tasks like sorting, filtering or rearranging. Although I have used R in the past, I never came to
like it despite the hught support by the community. I feel that some piece is missing, and that is maybe the heavily
typing for a data analysis language, poor language-level support for functional paradigms which are great for data
munging (map, reduce, filter and the like). Algorithms must be implemented in an imperative setting, which isn’t
sometimes the best option.</p>

<h3 id="the-present">The present</h3>

<p>Python comes in the middle of it all. It supports functional paradigms such as lambda functions (functions defined
where they are used), functions as first-class objects, and classical operations on collections. On the other hand,
Python has increasingly getting more support from the community and the amount of available libraries is astonishing.
It is true that the support for statistical analysis in Python cannot be compared to that or R yet, but Python is
steadily catching up, with ever increasing scientists switching in all disciplines. A number of mature projects
exist in all the areas, ranging from general Statistics to Neuroimaging. Several bridges exist to R packages with no
native counterpart. This, the language support for advanced features, optimized packages such as
<a href="www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">Cristoph Golke’s</a> (which include NumPy and SciPy versions statically compiled
against the highly efficient Intel’s MKL BLAS distributions) and the extra toolset derived from years of using
Python as a generalist scripting data (including a highly-productive web toolset), makes Python a worthy
next-generation substitute for R.</p>

<p>Imagine that we collect two time series of stock prices that originated in two different markets. These two markets
observe different holidays, so the raw time series that we get are unaligned (this is true for Yahoo Finance historical
data, for example). Our data pre-processing task is to align the data, keeping the last valid price for holidays where
the other market is open.</p>

<p>Pandas is a Python library that includes much of R functionality and is extremely handy for this kind of data munging
tasks. By creating DataFrame objects from our raw data, we access the kind of functionality we need. In this case, once
we have two DataFrame objects, <em>dt1</em> and <em>dt2</em>, where we simulates two weeks of data, by starting on Monday, 1st,
and ending on Friday, 12th. The first market observes a holiday on Friday the 5th, while the second observes a
holiday on Monday, 1st. We define the dataframes as follows:</p>

<p>We notice the dates are unsorted due to using the first dataframe, which skips friday (date 8 would be unsorted if we
were to use the <em>dt2</em> object). We sort on the <em>date</em> column. However, there is a bigger problem, we see NaNs,
Not a number values for column of a dataframe not defined in the other, since this is the usual outcome from the
outer merge. In this case, the <em>fillna</em> method of the DataFrame class with the <em>gap</em> policy will fit our purposes
(carry over the last valid value).</p>

<p>Of course, we have excellent IDEs to work with, ranging from generalist tools and plugins for major IDE frameworks
such as Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA, to more specialized editors such as the Matlab-like Spyder, IPython Notebook (embedded
in the IPython executable, which can be started with the option <code>-notebook</code>). Also, emerging editors such as the
celebrated Sublime Text and Light Table fully support Python.</p>

<h3 id="data-visualization-past-and-present">Data visualization: past and present</h3>

<p>An often overlooked side is data visualization. As people coming from the engineering side, where doing ugly and
hard to use things is almost a badge of pride, we never care about how our results look as long as they are correct
(in a sense that they fulfill their functional requirements). Presentation is not only important from the aesthetic
point of view, but can also help the experts discover patterns in the data that offer previously unknown clues about
the nature of our data.</p>

<p>Plotting Matlab graphs and pasting them on a Word document was the normal. R has an impressive set of graphical tools
that cope with the most exigent user. For the presentations, using PowerPoint was the thing to do in corporate
environments and the most adventurous could embark on the quest of using Latex Beamer for this purpose. Not any more.</p>

<p>The new normal will be web technologies. Web browsers are the most advanced graphical tool available to any user in the
world. The dynamic capabilities achieved by both CSS and Javascript make any other technology pale. To easy the burden
of dealing with raw CSS and Javascript, a number of libraries have been built on top of the browser native support.
Some of these rise above the others. I must mention <a href="http://d3js.org">D3js</a>, an impressive graphical library with
anything a data scientist with graphical needs might need. Visit their examples page to get a glance of the
capabilities.</p>

<iframe width="720" height="480" marginheight="-500" marginwidth="-300" src="http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111018/collision.html"></iframe>

<p>Lastly, PowerPoint and Latex Beamer users with professional needs will both shift to browser presentation technologies
such as <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">RevealJS</a>, which can be complemented with Latex renderers to achieve perfect
results for the mathematical formulae, on top of superior interactions.</p>

<h3 id="the-future">The future</h3>

<p>A large shift towards Python can be expected, especially in rapid prototyping. Even though R is not going away soon,
Python bindings will relegate R to a second class language, so to speak, in the same way as Fortran is today, this is,
there are many classical algorithms written in Fortran in the 70’s and 80’s still being in production today. This
includes a huge number of well-known and widely-used linear algebra libraries such as Netlib’s BLAS and LAPACK, which
are currently interfaced to other languages such as R.</p>

<p>Also, functional programming should play a role in data analysis. Lisps variants have an important advantage over imperative
paradigms such as working naturally with monads. This makes the use of the monad <em>some</em> very useful for list processing.
For example, in closure we can write</p>

</span><span class="line">        <span class="nv">process3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>which prevents us from using a large chain of nested if blocks for this conditional processing. However, Lisp syntax
is not well suited for rapid prototyping, where data scientists prefer a more imperative approach to define global
variables for later processing</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Functional languages might become, if not a rapid prototyping choice, indeed a data system deployment choice, since
a lot more data processing and state handling will need to be done. It is worth mentioning
<a href="http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.zip-api.html">zippers</a>,
<a href="https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.walk-api.html">walkers</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.match">match</a>, three libraries that make the programmer’s life easier by orders of
magnitude when dealing with data processing, but I will devote an article to them.</p>

<p>Regarding data visualization, it will be done primarily with web technologies on the browser, with AJAX data requests
to the server were the data processing and storage are done. Here, technologies such as D3js will be a must.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>In the future, it is conceivable to use an integrated framework that analyzes data with Python libraries and then
presents the results via a Python web server to multiple browsers.</p>

<p>As well as Java will not totally go away in the enterprise software development world, neither will current data processing
technologies such as Excel, PowerPoint, Matlab or R, since they have die hard niches. In particular, the huge amount of
existing libraries will need time to be adapted to Python.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is an interesting series of articles on <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/open-source/the-rise-and-fall-of-languages-in-2013/240165192">Dr. Dobb’s</a> essentially about what we can call the computer languages market, where they analyze trends and caracteristics, especially in the Editor in chief’s article.</p>

<p>They analyze the trends in language usage, which ordinally had not change since the year before (C, Java, Objective-C, C++, C#, PHP, Visual Basic, Python and Javascript), but that show a number of developments. For instance, Perl is leaving room in favor of Python. Perl seems to be dying and with signs of becoming history. They also mentioned a strong resurgence of Javascript but I would like to add that a large number of developments in the web scripting world have been carried out, starting with CoffeeScript, a tiny language that translates 1-to-1 to JavaScript. See their web page for some use of the language. ClojureScript is another compiler, this time to translate Clojure into JavaScript.</p>

<p>I found the following paragraph of particular interest (read more <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/jvm/the-rise-and-fall-of-languages-in-2012/240145800">here</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>By all measures, C++ use declined last year, demonstrating that C++11 was not enough to reanimate the language&#8217;s fortunes, despite the significant benefits it provides. I have previously opined that Microsoft&#8217;s contention of a return to native languages being led by C++ was unsupported by evidence. It is now clearly contradicted by the evidence.</p></blockquote>

<p>I feel encouraged by this statement. I believed C++ is an awful language, and always has been. Back in the late 90’s when I started programming and my teenage budget in a remote outpost included a non-disposable 486 DX2 with DOS, we had no choice but to get mainstream technical stuff, and that included C++ as the only advanced systems language. My experience, and I believe everybody’s experience, is that programmer’s time is more important than running time, and even hardcore C++ programmers recognize they put themselves in pain when facing non-standard tasks with the language. Some would argue that pain is what you pay for system performance, but that is not true (see the paragraph below). C++ will never grow on Big Data (data processing), mobile development or cloud computing, and I would expect that performance computing to also cut C++ usage in favor of more modern, maintainable system languages, such as the D language (or the one I describe below).</p>

<p>Another option they did not mention in the area of systems programming, more than the D language, is Nimrod. It has cool features such as pointers that are traced by a lightweight garbage collector and others that directly translate to C++ pointers. Templates that can be called as operators are included, supporting metaprogramming, it supports immutable objects, a number of syntactic sugars (such as being able to call len(x), x.len or x.len if there is only one argument, command and function-like calls like echo(“hello”) and echo “hello”…), first class functions and a very good mixture between Python indentation-defined blocks and Scala function definitions, as opposed to D’s C-like syntax. Nimrod compiles to C, C++, Objective C and JavaScript. Definitely a good candidate to learn and to watch.</p>

<p>On the functional but high-performant side of the market we have Erlang, Haskell, Scala and Clojure. The first three are older, especially the first two ones. In my opinion, Clojure is simplest, especially when compared to Scala. This is evident when examining a source code listing in both languages. Clojure lifts the programmer’s productivity to new heights.
It is worth mentioning at this point that there is a new promising contender in the field. It is <a href="http://drmeister.wordpress.com/2014/09/18/announcing-clasp/">Clasp</a>, a Common Lisp 2.0 compliant language that works with native C++ libraries with interoperability via the LLVM compiler framework. It is still in its inception and in a very alpha stage, but the prospective of using functional tools in a Lisp way with native C++ objects promises to raise productivity whenever time is of the essence. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Pythagorean Theorem is almost mainstream, everybody knows what it is about, yet not so many people know how to prove
it. Here is a proof that I consider to be the easiest one. It’s very analytic and avoids any geometric complications
 such as triangle similarity considerations.</p>

<p>Now, for this proof, you need to know basic geometrical notions such as the area of a square and the area of right
triangles.</p>

<p>Let a (large) square, be cut by a reflecting straight line such as the line builds an inner square and four right 
triangles, such as in the figure below. </p>

<p>Let one of the segments cut by the reflecting line be called $a$, and let the other be called $b$, which makes the
side of the large outer triangle $(a+b)$. In the smaller square,
let the side of the inner square be called $c$. These are the legs and the hypotenuse of the four right triangles.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/pythagorean.png" width="400" height="400" title="Pythagorean theorem" alt="images" /></p>

<p>Now, we know that the area $L$ of the large is its side squared, if arithmetic holds, 
<script type="math/tex">
L=(a+b)^2=a^2 + b^2 + 2ab
</script> </p>

<p>On the other hand, the large outer square is made up of four right triangles, whose individual area is $\frac{ab}{2}$ and
the inner square, whose area is $c^2$. Thus</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
L=4 \times \frac{ab}{2} + c^2
</script>

<p>Equating both expressions, we can arrive at the result of the theorem</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = 4 \frac{ab}{2} + c^2 \\
a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = 2 \times ab + c^2\\
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
</script>

<p>Notice that only axioms about angle reflection and straight lines are needed for this theorem (for example, we need
to establish that a straight line reflects on another straight line with the complementary angle of both straight lines).</p>

<p>I made the image above and it is copylefted. If you want to use the SVG version, feel free to drop me an email.</p>
