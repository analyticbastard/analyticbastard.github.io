    <h2>I like Windows 10 and the new Microsoft (despite their past)</h2>
</div>
<div>
    
    <p>I hate to say this, but I like Windows 10. It seems that starting to remove old school people from the picture, including Bill Gates and their friends, is starting to pay off.</p><p>Microsoft products have always been mediocre, a cheap refurbish of ideas already implemented or circulating around. I understand the complexity of a massive (and conservative) customer base such as theirs, but that is no obstacle for the myriad of mistakes they've had in the past.</p><p>They skipped ever single technology revolution since the Internet began being popular among the masses. Furthermore, they have single-handedly prevented a healthy Internet development since before the dotcom and I estimate the advances in every aspect of Internet technology has come five to ten years later because of them.</p><p>The first great Microsoft latch is, of course Internet Explorer. During the 90s and the first decade of the XXI century, Internet Explorer enjoyeda predominant position, thanks to it being shipped with Windows (which will come next). Because of this, Microsoft crippled the emergence of new Internet technologies beginning with proper development of standards due to poor/late implementation feedback (I am talking about CSS, Javascript and pretty much anything that depends on it). Internet Explorer has been the nightmare of web developers for 15 years. 15 years! For these years they've needed to cope with Microsoft special interest in forcing the web towards their closed standards to gain a competitive advantage by de facto controlling the development and make it harder for competitors to bring in their products because of the (often hidden) special features (and errors).</p><p>The second shame for Microsoft has been Windows. In the 90s they were never at par with Apple in what a graphical experience is concerned, even though Apple had been stagnant since Steve Jobs was fired. Nevertheless, they enjoyed a much larger customer base and Windows 95 was a new beginning. Its interface was very innovative, so innovative that it has lived on to the present day. However, they stayed there. Windows 98 and Me did not bring anything innovative to the table. Windows XP was the next big step for them, but not so much in UX innovation as it was because of the change in architecture. Out of a Windows 3.1 based operating system codebase, Microsoft put people in a serious NT based codebase. This step had already been starting to take place with Windows 2000, so the convergence of the whole world to an NT codebase had already been set in motion before and deadline of XP. That is why I don't regard the pre-NT and post-NT times as innovative. Then nothing happened. The more people grew used to XP the more reluctant Microsoft was to innovate (both because of a very convenient position and the broad range of interests of their customer base). They tried and fail to do something new with the infamous Vista. Then Windows 7 shipped with minimal look changes to keep everybody happy. Yet another failed attempt was Windows 8, which promised to bring Windows to the XXI century but miserably failed (I applauded their efforts for trying, tough). Its interface was neither usable nor intuitive.</p><p>In the programming area, I always regarded Microsoft as a complete disaster. Starting with their "hungarian notation", which challenges the whole Uncle Bob variable naming chapter, their OLE/COM component model, whose results are even ludicrous and ended up with their attempt to kidnap the Internet with their ActiveX, which of course only worked on Windows. The .Net framework is questionable too, since, despite of fulfilling its purpose and being solidly designed, it remains a Windows thing purely because of political reasons, since Microsoft could have popularized it on other systems. Theirs build tools have been a nightmare (even though cl.exe is a fine compiler). Unintuitive, old-looking, unproductive, you name it. And what about the horrors of their version control tools?</p><p>And then came Nadella. I believe the guy has a fresh vision and we are seeing steps in a more innovative direction. The first one is the new Windows 10. It encourages the usage of the Windows key somehow, comes with (often not working or ofter breaking) new features like Cortana or basic implementation of virtual desktops (which need to improve to be at par with Mac OS X or Gnome 3). Better settings, nice animations, slick interface. I can honestly say that I like Windows 10. Not for professional work since I use a lot of Unix command line and I like true Unix for that, but it definitely feels better than older versions at home. They need to get themselves together, tough. The last milestone update, Windows Anniversary Update, is almost impossible to get installed on a computer, and has become famous for bringing that desperation feeling back from Windows 98.</p><p>A remarkable job is Visual Studio Code, a lightweight very extensible modern editor free of charge by Microsoft. This, even more than the Windows 10 free update, is free forever and their code is hosted on Github. This is part of the new modern "it's there for you to take, use it if you like and improve it if you can, we'll figure out how to monetize it later" attitude.</p><p>So yes, I like the new Microsoft. They are finally back to the future.</p>
